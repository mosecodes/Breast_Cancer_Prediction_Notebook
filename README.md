### Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

This is my University capstone project. It involves using scikit learn to build a jupyter notebook that predicts the likelyhood of a malignant tumor in women's breast tissue. 

The ML Algorithm is a logistic regression that uses 9 different factors (or dimensions) to build a probability hyperplane which classifies a patient based on their symptoms, family history, and tumor details. 

To view the notebook, select the <code>CapstoneProject.ipynb</code> file. Github should render it, but if you need you can always clone the repo to build it on your machine.

Thanks for checking it out!
